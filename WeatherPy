### Project Proposal: WeatherPy - Your Personalized Weather Companion

#### Project Name and Tagline
**Project Name:** WeatherPy  
**Tagline:** Your personalized weather forecasting and alert system.

#### Team Members
**Team:**
- **Taissir Lassoued 
#### Technologies
**Technologies:**
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Platforms:** Heroku, GitHub
- **Frameworks:** Flask (for backend), React (for frontend)
- **Hardware:** Standard development machines
- **Books/Resources:** "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron

**Technology Trade-offs:**
1. **Flask vs. Django:**  
   - **Chosen:** Flask  
   - **Alternate:** Django  
   - **Trade-offs:** Flask is lightweight and allows for greater flexibility and control over the components. Django, on the other hand, is more feature-rich but can be too heavy for small projects. Flask was chosen due to its simplicity and ease of use for small to medium-sized applications.

2. **React vs. Angular:**  
   - **Chosen:** React  
   - **Alternate:** Angular  
   - **Trade-offs:** React offers a more straightforward learning curve and flexibility in terms of integration with other libraries. Angular provides a more opinionated and comprehensive framework. React was chosen for its flexibility and large community support.

#### Challenge Statement
**Challenge:**
- **Problem Description:** Many weather applications provide generic forecasts that are not tailored to individual user preferences or specific activities.
- **Scope Limitations:** This project will not address extreme weather predictions or climate change data analysis.
- **Target Users:** Outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, event planners, and anyone needing personalized weather forecasts.
- **Locale Dependency:** The project is not locale-specific but will initially focus on regions with reliable weather data APIs.

#### Risks
**Risks:**
- **Technical Risks:** 
  - **Risk:** API reliability and accuracy
  - **Impact:** Inaccurate or delayed forecasts
  - **Safeguards:** Use multiple APIs and cross-verify data

- **Non-Technical Risks:**
  - **Risk:** User adoption and engagement
  - **Impact:** Low usage of the application
  - **Strategies:** Implement user feedback loops and continuous improvement based on user input

#### Infrastructure
**Infrastructure:**
- **Branching and Merging:** Use GitHub flow with feature branches and pull requests for code review and merging.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Deploy the application on Heroku with continuous integration using GitHub Actions.
- **Data Population:** Use weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and populate weather data.
- **Testing Tools:** Utilize PyTest for backend testing, Jest for frontend testing, and Selenium for end-to-end testing.

#### Existing Solutions
**Existing Solutions:**
- **AccuWeather:** Provides accurate weather forecasts but lacks personalization features.
- **Weather.com:** Offers comprehensive weather data but is not tailored to individual user needs.
- **Dark Sky:** Known for its hyperlocal forecasts but was discontinued as an API service.

**Reimplementation Rationale:** While existing solutions provide accurate weather data, they do not offer the level of personalization and user-specific alerts that WeatherPy aims to deliver. WeatherPy will leverage machine learning to provide tailored forecasts and alerts, setting it apart from generic weather services.
